# PRIORITY QUEUE:

In this data structure, each element is associated with a priority value. And elements are served on the basis of their piority. If elements have the same priority, they are served according to their order in the queue.

Generally, the value of the element is considered its priority. For example, the element with the highest value is considered highest priority.

## Implementation:

Can be implemented using an array, linked list, a heap data structure or a binary search tree. Of all of this, the heap data structure provides the most efficient Implementation.
